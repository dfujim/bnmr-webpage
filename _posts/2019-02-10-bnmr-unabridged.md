Here is my attempt to compile an unabridged collection of
[β-NMR](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssnmr.2015.02.004) publications by
the [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/)/[TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/) group. This is
partially motivated by the fact that the lists at
[bnmr.triumf.ca](http://bnmr.triumf.ca) are both incomplete and outdated, making
it laborious to find the missing work, especially you are unfamiliar with the
~15 years of literature. My hope is rectify this.
I also feel that the presentation at [bnmr.triumf.ca](http://bnmr.triumf.ca)
could be improved, too. The layout here just copies that of my own
[publications](/publications), but I may experiment with fancier styles for this
"catalog" (e.g., a [timeline](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp)).

This compilation is organized into the following categories:
* [Preprints](#preprints)
* [Journal Articles](#journals)
* [Conference Proceedings](#proceedings)
* [Student Theses](#theses)

The entries are sorted in reverse chronological order from the date of (online)
publication.

It is interesting to see the research directions evolve over time.
